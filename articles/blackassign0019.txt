By understanding, consumer behavior marketers can fill in the gap of how consumers buy a product and identify the product that is needed ad the obsolete products. Studying consumer behavior can help marketers to present the product in a way that yields higher consumer attraction. Understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers. How marketing influences consumer decisions? The primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. The best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. Modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. Let’s examine the how and why in more detail. Regularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. They pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. Customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably. Instead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. Even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. It occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. The brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. When buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly. Nike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. Its tagline, “Just Do It,” speaks for itself. Allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers.

But in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. It’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. With a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. If you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. Marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment. Take, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. Rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. Companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. In this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. Today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. If it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break Instagram records.
